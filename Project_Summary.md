*A project on whole-genome assembly, annotation and phylogenetic analysis*

Our project involved whole-genome reconstruction from short reads, genome annotation, extraction of meaningful and tractable 
information from the whole genome, and phylogenetic reconstruction.In this project, we used data generated from 2nd-generation 
sequencers (Illumina HiSeq).The samples we used for our project pertained to several isolates of M. oryzae. During the course of 
this mini-project we acquired skills in high throughput sequence analysis, data manipulation and phylogenetic analysis.
